The goal of Project1378 is to provide functions to use to do complete statistical tests.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Project1378 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Project1378")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("AngusFreeman/Project1378")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
##library(Project1378)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
